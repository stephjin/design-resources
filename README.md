## Sketch Plugins

1. [Runner](https://sketchrunner.com/)

OS X Spotlight for Sketch. Way easier to hit hotkey to activate and search all commands, jump to artboards or layers, and plugins.

2. [Artboard Tricks](https://github.com/romannurik/Sketch-ArtboardTricks)

Organized Sketch file is a happy Sketch file. Sometimes you can get a little crazy with moving artboards around, this rearranges them all nice for you.

3. [Character Count](https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-character-count)

No one likes to read really long lines of text, cut that down to 70 or below!

4. [Distributor](https://github.com/PEZ/SketchDistributor)

Evenly space your elements!

5. [Preview in Browser](https://github.com/gaddafirusli/Preview-in-browser)

Sometimes Craft doesn't want to sync or if it takes too long, I'll quickly throw artboards into the browser to preview them. Also feels closer to real life than InVision.

6.[Text box fit content](https://github.com/juliussohn/sketch-textbox-fit-content)

I love InDesign's fit to text box and felt really lost without it in Sketch.

7. [Craft](https://www.invisionapp.com/craft)

Duh for InVision
